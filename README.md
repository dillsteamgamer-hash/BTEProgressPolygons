A plugin aimed for BTE servers that allows approved players to mark areas of progress through the usage of polygons.

It is also recommended to use this plugin alongside my other plugin 'BTEAuditPlugin', which can be found on my GitHub profile.
It may also be a good idea to have a plugin that allows for recording the number of builds on the server. I know one exists as is on BTE UK, but I can't find a repo for it.

Player Usage:
1) /getpolygonprogresstool
2) Left-click to start a new selection
3) Right-click to add a new point
4) /makeprogresspolygon [name] -- Recommended to go into the config file to alert users to the server's standard naming system
Done!

Notes:
-/toggleprogresspolygonvisibility must have been executed to see the polygons once added to the database
-Deleting polygons requires 2 approvals
-This was very questionably implemented, doesn't seem to cause lag issues, but somebody is free to optimise this better if they want!
